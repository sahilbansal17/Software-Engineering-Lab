(a)
The various windows displayed in the SPIN run are: 
- Automata View: Display automata similar to FSM of the program
- Data window: Display value of the variables
- Message Sequence Chart: Display communication using channels
- Process Sequence: Display sequence of execution
- Queue: Display channels

Running the program with different seeds provides different outputs in the data window.
Seed = 1234567 gives an output of x = 2, y = 4
Seed = 123456 gives an output of x = 2, y = 5

Thus, seed value is used to provide non-deterministic behavior to the program execution.
Everytime the program is run with the same seed value, we get the same output.

(b)
Seed = 1 => state = 2
seed = 3 => state = 1
seed = 4 => state = 0

(c)
Seed = 1 => state = 1
seed = 3 => state = 1
seed = 4 => state = 1
seed = 6 => state = 2
seed = 10 => state = 0

(d)
Seed = 1 => state = 2
seed = 3 => state = 2
seed = 4 => state = 0
seed = 6 => state = 2
seed = 10 => state = 0

The output can never be equal to 1 now since all statements inside atomic in proctype must be executed without interrupt.
